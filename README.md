# Alex Jackman's Design Portfolio
I haven't gotten around to making a webpage yet, since I'm still playing around with some JS frameworks and web hosting technologies, so I'll put my stuff in here for now. I'll use this repository to store the source code for the website when I make it.

Without further ado, these are my UI designs.

## Publist
Publist (short for Public List) is a municipal information directory that delivers the user political and public information about their home town. I've been thinking about an app that allows users to know their local departments, represenatives, and elections, so that they have the knowlege and resources they need to be a more active member of their community.

I designed these a while ago and my thoughts on what to do for this app has changed since, such as removing the news section and limiting events only to coucil meetings and forums. Nonetheless, these are my initial ideas.

## Portfol.io
As an artist, it can be frusterating to come to terms with how limiting our options are in terms of art sharing and social media; Twitter crops images in their feed, Instagram only uploads on mobile and directly from camera roll, and DeviantArt is very complicated and lacks an adequite mobile app. 

So to address these problems, I've been thinking of varying social media solutions for artists. This is one of my ideas, reminicent of Instagram's simple and adaptable UI. There are more options I'd like to work on over time.

## Graphics Assets
These are some buttons I made for my DeviantArt page back when I was in Snow College. I don't use these anymore (in fact, I'm no longer active on most of these sites) but I'm quite proud of how they came out, despite how little they work with today's design standards.
